Part A 
In the first part of this assessment, you must design, code, and test a program that uses Python to manage PDF files. 
1. Write a Python program that provides the ability to: 
1.1. Merge at least two PDF files into one. Use list data structure with at least two PDF files. As an optional bonus you can create an empty list and ask for user input to populate empty list with user-defined PDF files.
1.2. Rotate a page in PDF file.
1.3. Encrypt PDF file.
1.4. Decrypt PDF file.
